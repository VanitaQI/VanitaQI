- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @VanitaQI
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in advancing my expertise in computer science and learning more about computer science to apply to future professions.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to apply introductory Java to complete large tasks. This year, I completed the AP Computer Science A, 
     and learned the Java language as part of the course. I also know the Python programming language from my work in AP Computer Science
     Principles, a course I received the top score of 5 on.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me ...
     Please contact me at my email vanitaqindrakumar@gmail.com, or find me on LinkedIn under the name Vanita Indrakumar.
